## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdombrov-33/vault-66-store.git
cd vault-66-store
npm install
```

### Create a .env file from the example

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open .env and fill in your own API keys and secrets (e.g. for Clerk, Stripe, Supabase, OpenRouter, etc.).

⚠️ Without valid credentials, some features like authentication, checkout, and AI chat won't work.

### Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker

⚠️ Important: Regardless of whether you run with Docker Compose or pull and run the Docker image manually, you need to create and fill your own .env file with the required environment variables before starting the app. Without valid environment variables, features like authentication, payments, and AI chat won’t work.

### 1. Run with Docker Compose

`docker-compose.yml` is already configured, so simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will build (if necessary) and start the container, mapping ports and loading your environment variables as configured.

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the app.

To stop the container, press `Ctrl+C` or run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 2. Pull and run the image manually

If you want to use the pre-built official image without Docker Compose, run:

```bash
docker pull vexenbay/vault-66:latest
```

Then start the container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env vexenbay/vault-66:latest
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

To stop the container, press `Ctrl+C`.
